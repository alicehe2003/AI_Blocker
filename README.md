# AI_Blocker
A Chrome extension to censor any AI/ML related words because there's just too much of it floating around. Full disclosure: this is a meme project. And yes, it was made largely with the help of AI. Ironic, isn't it? 

## I'm not against AI, I'm just against using it for EVERYTHING. 

Anyways, here's a sales pitch that AI wrote for me: 

## Are you TIRED of seeing certain letter combinations that make you inexplicably uncomfortable? 

Do acronyms like "AI" and "ML" fill you with an indescribable sense of dread? 

Well, suffer NO MORE! 

🎯 This extension instantly transforms words like "AI" and "ML" into what they ACTUALLY mean - "AlmostIntelligent🤪" and "MostlyLucky🍀"

### 🧠 The science behind it: 

Our team of highly qualified developers (Alice + various LLMs) have created a REVOLUTIONALY algorithm that: 
1. Scans every webpage you visit. 
2. Identifies dangerous words. 
3. Replaces them with a much user-friendlier alternative. 
4. (May occasionally crash your browser because it's completely untested, but that's just part of the experience!)

### 💡 Real testimonials: 

"I used to break out in a cold sweat every time I saw 'AI' on a webpage. Now I just see 'AlmostIntelligent🤪' and I'm completely cured!" - Totally Real Person

"Finally, and extension that protects me from the tyranny of ML acronyms!" - Another Real Person 

"My browser crashed 47 times, but at least I never had to see 'ML' again!" - Satisfied Customer
